SYNOPSIS

A filetype plugin to encourage the GNU C style.
					
sUMMARY

The GNU Coding Standards encourage the use of a C style not supported by
default.  This script provides convenience support when editing C sources
according to the C style guidelines encouraged in the Standards by overruling
the default C ftplugin, which uses a style closer to the Linux kernel style.

The GNU Coding standards are available at:

	http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards.html

See |C-Indenting| and |format-comments| for an idea of what the script does.

USAGE

Place this file into your ftplugin directory. See |ftplugin-overrule| for
information about how the script overrules Bram's ftplugin.  To have the script
activate, place 'filetype plugin on' in your |.vimrc| file.
See |ftplugins| for more information on this topic.
