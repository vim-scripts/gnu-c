The GNU Coding Standards encourage the use of a C style not supported by default.  This script provides convenience support when editing C sources according to the C style guidelines encouraged in the Standards by overruling the default C ftplugin, which uses a style closer to the Linux kernel style.

The GNU Coding standards are available at:

See |C-Indenting| and |format-comments| for an idea of what the script does.
